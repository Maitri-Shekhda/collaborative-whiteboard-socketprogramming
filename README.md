Collaborative Whiteboard Using Socket Programming based on Tkinter Python
This repository contains Python scripts for a collaborative whiteboard application that allows multiple users to draw on a shared canvas in real-time. The project consists of two main components: a client-side application for drawing on the canvas and sending drawing commands to the server, and a server-side application that manages client connections and broadcasts drawing commands to all connected clients.
Features
Real-time collaborative drawing on a shared canvas
Choose color functionality for drawing
Undo functionality to remove the last drawn shape
Secure communication using SSL/TLS encryption
